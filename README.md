### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look at the temperature data from the months of June and December to determine whether or not Oahu, Hawaii will be able to sustain surf and ice cream shop business year-round.

### Summary

In comparing temperature data for the months of June (2010-2017) and December (2010-2016), it is evident that the maximum temperatures are very close (85 and 83 °F). However, December trends a bit lower in terms of minimum and average temperatures (56 / 71 °F compared to June’s 64 / 75 °F).

In addition to the temperatures, I’ve performed two more queries to compare precipitation amounts for the same range of years for both June and December. As seen below, December’s average (0.22 mm) trends toward having slightly more precipitation than June’s (0.14 mm). While, both months show that there can be the possibility of heavy precipitation at some point, their average amounts are closer to their minimums. This means we can determine that there will be more sunny days to surf and eat ice cream than rainy days.

-	Minimum Precipitation
    - June: 0 mm
    - December: 0 mm
-	Maximum Precipitation
    - June: 4.43 mm
    - December: 6.42 mm
-	Average Precipitation (Mean)
    - June: 0.14 mm
    - December: 0.22 mm

In conclusion, while December can be slightly cooler than June, the temperatures are still ideal for year-round surfing and ice cream snacking. The precipitation scores also support this by showing that there isn’t enough rainfall to interfere either. Based on these findings, Oahu appears to be an ideal place for this type of business.
